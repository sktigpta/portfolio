            <p>
                I am a self-motivated and passionate Computer Science undergraduate from Rungta College of Engineering and Technology, currently pursuing my B.Tech (2022-2026) with a CGPA of 8.0. I aim to leverage my technical and soft skills in a dynamic organization to contribute to its growth while enhancing my professional journey. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                My expertise spans web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and AWS, with hands-on experience in tools such as Visual Studio Code and WordPress. I have worked on projects including a decentralized voting platform (DiamPoll) and a product rental website (RentBlee). Beyond coding, I enjoy traveling, watching movies, and continuously learning new skills to stay adaptable.
